## 🧘 Relax. Let expresso-macchiato handle it.
Writing a fully operational backend server—with routes, a database, and documentation—shouldn’t feel like crafting a rocket 🚀. With expresso-macchiato, the setup is minimal, the structure is clean, and the flexibility is in your hands.

No more boilerplate. No more endless wiring.

## 🧩 What is expresso-macchiato?
expresso-macchiato is a lightweight but powerful Node.js framework built on top of Express and TypeORM. It simplifies the process of:

- Creating and exposing RESTful routes from entity definitions.
- Generating and serving a Swagger schema out of the box.
- Bootstrapping your entire app (routes, database, sockets, etc.) with a single class.

It's designed for developers who want to go from zero to production-ready server in minutes.


Writing this:
```ts
export const noteRoutes = new RouterWrapper({
    tag:'note',
    basePath:'/api/note',
    dbRouting:
    {
        entity: Note,
        secure: { user_id: { tokenKey: 'id', methods: "*" } },
        getParameters: [{ in: 'query', like:true, name:'content' }],
        bodyParameters: Swagger.createSchema({ content: { type: 'string', } }),
    }
});
```
and mounting it to the Starter, you will:
1. Create dynamic routes for your entity.
2. Secure them with a token, with eventually some logics to query the db with the decrypted payload
3. Create the swagger documentation you can access right after.


## 🏁 Quick Start
The fastest way to get started with expresso-macchiato is using the official project scaffolding:

```bash
npx create-expresso-macchiato
```

This command sets up a complete and ready-to-use template, optimized for working with expresso-macchiato.

**Why this is the recommended way:**
1. Preconfigured build system using TSUP.
2. Includes jwe-token-based authentication and pre-exposed API routes.
3. Built-in MinIO utility for handling image storage from Docker.
4. Comes with a Dockerfile and docker-compose setup out of the box.
5. Includes prefilled .env files and a .gitignore tailored for Node/TypeScript projects.

You just need to:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

And you're good to go! 🎉
This will:
* Connect to the database
* Expose some demo routes
* Serve auto-generated Swagger docs at /swagger-ui

### 🛠️ Manual Installation
Prefer starting from scratch? You can install expresso-macchiato directly into your own project:

```bash
